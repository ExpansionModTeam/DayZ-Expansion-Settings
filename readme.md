This files are for education purpose only.

They are not meant to be used on your server directly but instead to provide various examples of what is possible.

If you are missing a file, our system will recreate the broken file if this one has been removed or renamed.
Please note some files will only comeback if the folder is missing. For example any files from the Market folder will only comeback if the **folder** is missing.
